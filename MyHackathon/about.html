        <h2 class="title_main">The famous Coffee House, a business that dates back to the 18th century.</h2>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>The Coffee House is a historical institution in the center of Amsterdam. 
                    Named after House - a legendary "tipsy and jolly character" whose name has been used for many brands and for cafes and bars - it opened its doors as early as 1860.
                    The oldest and best-loved caf√© in the city, known to attract figures such as Oscar Wilde and Gabriele D'Annunzio, 
                    for centuries it was a meeting point for intellectuals and artists and today is an atmospheric place to grab a coffee or a drink, 
                    depending on the time of day, or food, depending on your budget. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    When the second owner, Coffee, took over in 1889, 
                    the House was redecorated by the architect Antonio Curri and countless contemporary artists were hired to create a fantastic mural, 
                    including Luca Postiglione, Pietro Scoppetta, Vincenzo Volpe, Attilio Pratella, Giuseppe De Sanctis, Giuseppe Casciaro, Gaetano Esposito, Vincenzo Migliaro, Vincenzo Irolli, and Vincenzo Caprile. 
                    To this day, their work and the Art Nouveau interior can still be admired, so the whole exudes a beautiful Belle Epoque atmosphere.
                </p>
                
                <p>Come and enjoy the beautiful interior, a luxurious cioccolata calda (hot chocolate) or an Amsterdam coffee with a frothy sugar crema, 
                    a well-deserved Spritz at the end of the day, or a delicious pastry to complete it.
