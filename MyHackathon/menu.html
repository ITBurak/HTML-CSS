                        Arabica beans are by far the most popular type of coffee beans, making up about 60% of the world's coffee. 
                        These tasty beans originated many centuries ago in the highlands of Ethiopia, and may even be the first coffee beans ever consumed! 
                        The name Arabica likely comes from the beans popularity in 7th-century Arabia (present-day Yemen).
                        The downside of Arabica beans is that they are harder to grow. Because of this, Arabica beans are pricier. 
                        All coffee beans grow in the so-called Bean Belt, an area between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, in 50 countries around the world. 
                        But Arabica beans need extra shade, water, and high altitude to grow properly. 
                        These plants are more susceptible to plant diseases and must be grown at an altitude of at least 2,000 feet. 
                        They are also smaller plants, measuring between 8 and 15 feet when fully grown.

                        The second most popular type of coffee bean is Robusta. 
                        This bean originated in sub-Saharan Africa and is now grown primarily in Africa and Indonesia.
                        It is also particularly popular in Vietnam and is often mixed into coffee blends. 
                        It is a less expensive variety, making it a very budget-friendly choice for roasters.
                        Robusta beans are larger and more rounded than the other bean varieties. 
                        These plants typically grow much larger than Arabica plants, measuring between 15 and 20 feet. 
                        Robusta beans are typically considered to be hardier because they can grow at lower altitudes and resist diseases. 
                        But recent research suggests that they don't handle heat as well as was previously thought.

                        Native to central and western Africa - specifically Liberia, hence its name - Coffea liberica is prized for its piquant floral aroma and bold, smoky flavor profile.
                        This hardy species is frequently mixed with other varieties to add body and complexity, but rarely receives any credit. 
                        Unheard of in Western civilization before the late 1800s, 
                        Liberica gained a foothold with Southeast Asian coffee producers after a fungal disease (“coffee rust”) wiped out much of the region's Arabica crops.
                        Growing from a much larger plant than Arabica or Robusta, most Liberica cherries tend to be irregular in shape and closer to Robusta in size and general appearance. 
                        It's also tolerant of hot, humid climates and does well at low altitude. 
                        Now produced mainly in Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines, the bean makes up roughly 2% of the world's coffee supply. 
                        Over 95% percent of the Malaysian coffee yield is Liberica beans. However, it is not commonly found in North American and European markets.

                        The fourth major type of coffee bean is called Excelsa. 
                        Though it was once considered a separate coffee species, scientists recently reclassified it as a Liberica variant.
                        Excelsa beans grow almost entirely in Southeast Asia, and they are shaped somewhat like Liberica beans — elongated ovals. 
                        These beans grow on large 20 to 30-foot coffee plants at medium altitudes.
